    <h3>Act I — Scene: A rocky sea-shore on the coast of Cornwall</h3>

    <pre>
    RUTH: Oh, take me with you! I cannot live if I am left behind.

    FREDERIC: Ruth, I will be quite candid with you. You are very dear to me,
    as you know, but I must be circumspect. You see, you are considerably
    older than I. A lad of twenty-one usually looks for a wife of seventeen.

    RUTH: A wife of seventeen! You will find me a wife of a thousand!

    FREDERIC: No, but I shall find you a wife of forty-seven, and that is quite
    enough. Ruth, tell me candidly and without reserve: compared with other
    women, how are you?

    RUTH: I will answer you truthfully, master: I have a slight cold, but
    otherwise I am quite well.

    FREDERIC: I am sorry for your cold, but I was referring rather to your
    personal appearance. Compared with other women, are you beautiful?

    RUTH: (bashfully) I have been told so, dear master.

    FREDERIC: Ah, but lately?

    RUTH: Oh, no; years and years ago.

    FREDERIC: What do you think of yourself?

    RUTH: It is a delicate question to answer, but I think I am a fine woman.

    FREDERIC: That is your candid opinion?

    RUTH: Yes, I should be deceiving you if I told you otherwise.

    FREDERIC: Thank you, Ruth. I believe you, for I am sure you would not
    practice on my inexperience. I wish to do the right thing, and if— I say if—
    you are really a fine woman, your age shall be no obstacle to our union!
    (Shakes hands with her. Chorus of girls heard in the distance, "climbing
    over rocky mountain," etc.)
    Hark! Surely I hear voices! Who has ventured to approach our all but
    inaccessible lair?

    RUTH: (aside) Confusion! it is the voices of young girls! If he should see
    them I am lost.

    FREDERIC: (looking off) By all that's marvellous, a bevy of beautiful maidens!

    RUTH: (aside) Lost! lost! lost!
