    <h3>Act I — Scene: A rocky sea-shore on the coast of Cornwall</h3>

    <pre>
    <h5>RUTH</h5>: Oh, take me with you! I cannot live if I am left behind.

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: Ruth, I will be quite candid with you. You are very dear to me,
    as you know, but I must be circumspect. You see, you are considerably
    older than I. A lad of twenty-one usually looks for a wife of seventeen.

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: A wife of seventeen! You will find me a wife of a thousand!

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: No, but I shall find you a wife of forty-seven, and that is quite
    enough. Ruth, tell me candidly and without reserve: compared with other
    women, how are you?

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: I will answer you truthfully, master: I have a slight cold, but
    otherwise I am quite well.

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: I am sorry for your cold, but I was referring rather to your
    personal appearance. Compared with other women, are you beautiful?

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: (bashfully) I have been told so, dear master.

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: Ah, but lately?

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: Oh, no; years and years ago.

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: What do you think of yourself?

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: It is a delicate question to answer, but I think I am a fine woman.

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: That is your candid opinion?

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: Yes, I should be deceiving you if I told you otherwise.

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: Thank you, Ruth. I believe you, for I am sure you would not
    practice on my inexperience. I wish to do the right thing, and if— I say if—
    you are really a fine woman, your age shall be no obstacle to our union!
    (Shakes hands with her. Chorus of girls heard in the distance, "climbing
    over rocky mountain," etc.)
    Hark! Surely I hear voices! Who has ventured to approach our all but
    inaccessible lair?

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: (aside) Confusion! it is the voices of young girls! If he should see
    them I am lost.

    <h5>FREDERIC</h5>: (looking off) By all that's marvellous, a bevy of beautiful maidens!

    <h5>RUTH</h5>: (aside) Lost! lost! lost!
