    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Oh, take me with you! I cannot live if I am left behind.</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Ruth, I will be quite candid with you. You are very dear to me,
    as you know, but I must be circumspect. You see, you are considerably
    older than I. A lad of twenty-one usually looks for a wife of seventeen.</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>A wife of seventeen! You will find me a wife of a thousand!</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>No, but I shall find you a wife of forty-seven, and that is quite
    enough. Ruth, tell me candidly and without reserve: compared with other
    women, how are you?</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>I will answer you truthfully, master: I have a slight cold, but
    otherwise I am quite well.</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>I am sorry for your cold, but I was referring rather to your
    personal appearance. Compared with other women, are you beautiful?</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="direction">(bashfully)</p> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>I have been told so, dear master.</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Ah, but lately?</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Oh, no; years and years ago.</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>What do you think of yourself?</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>It is a delicate question to answer, but I think I am a fine woman.</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>That is your candid opinion?</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Yes, I should be deceiving you if I told you otherwise.</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Thank you, Ruth. I believe you, for I am sure you would not
    practice on my inexperience. I wish to do the right thing, and if— I say if—
    you are really a fine woman, your age shall be no obstacle to our union!</p>
    
    <p class="direction">(Shakes hands with her. Chorus of girls heard in the distance, "climbing
    over rocky mountain," etc.)</p>

    <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Hark! Surely I hear voices! Who has ventured to approach our all but
    inaccessible lair?</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="direction">(aside)</p> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Confusion! it is the voices of young girls! If he should see
    them I am lost.</p>

    <h5 class="name frederic">FREDERIC</h5> <p class="direction">(looking off)</p> <p class="speech frederic"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>By all that's marvellous, a bevy of beautiful maidens!</p>

    <h5 class="name ruth">RUTH</h5> <p class="direction">(aside)</p> <p class="speech ruth"><strong>RECITATIVE.</strong>Lost! lost! lost!</p>
